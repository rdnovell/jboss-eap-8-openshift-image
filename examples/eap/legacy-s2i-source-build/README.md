# Building an EAP 8.1 application image using EAP 8.1 S2I legacy source build

In this example we are building and deploying to OpenShift an application that has been migrated to use Jakarta EE 10 
but has not been updated to use the [EAP Maven Plugin](https://github.com/jbossas/eap-maven-plugin).

# Use-cases

* User wants to keep the EAP 7.4.x S2I workflow. Start from a github source repository, use latest released EAP 8.1 artifacts and images.

# Helm Chart provisioning configuration

EAP 8.1 provisioning configuration (feature-packs, layers and channels) is defined in EAP 8.1 Helm Chart yaml file.

```
...
build:
  s2i:
    featurePacks:
      - org.jboss.eap:wildfly-ee-galleon-pack
      - org.jboss.eap.cloud:eap-cloud-galleon-pack
    galleonLayers:
      - jaxrs-server
    channels:
      - org.jboss.eap.channels:eap-8.1
 ...
```

High level view of the Helm Chart configuration.

## Galleon feature-packs

* `org.jboss.eap:wildfly-ee-galleon-pack`
* `org.jboss.eap.cloud:eap-cloud-galleon-pack`

NB, the versions of the feature-packs are retrieved from the latest EAP 8.1 channel: `org.jboss.eap.channels:eap-8.1`

## Galleon layers

* `jaxrs-server`

## CLI scripts

JBoss EAP CLI scripts executed at packaging time

* None

## Extra content

Extra content packaged inside the provisioned server

* None

# Openshift build and deployment

Technologies required to build and deploy this example

* Helm chart for EAP 8.1 `jboss-eap/eap81`.

# Pre-requisites

* You have a `Registry Service Account`. You can [create one](https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/).

* [Not needed for OpenShift Sandbox] You have downloaded the Openshift secret file allowing to pull images in openshift. For detailed instructions check the URL: https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/#/token/<your user id>/openshift-secret`

* You are logged into an OpenShift cluster and have `oc` command in your path.

* You have installed Helm. Please refer to [Installing Helm page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Helm in your environment

* You have installed the repository for the Helm charts for EAP 8.1

 ```
helm repo add jboss-eap https://jbossas.github.io/eap-charts/
```

# Example steps

1. Setup to pull EAP 8.1 s2i builder and runtime images in Openshift [only required for on-premise installation of OpenShift, not needed for OpenShift Sandbox]

Create the authentication token secret for your OpenShift project using the YAML file that you downloaded:

```
oc create -f 1234567_myserviceaccount-secret.yaml
```

Configure the secret for your OpenShift project using the following commands, 
replacing the secret name in the example with the name of your secret created in the previous step.

```
oc secrets link default 1234567-myserviceaccount-pull-secret --for=pull
oc secrets link builder 1234567-myserviceaccount-pull-secret --for=pull
```

2. Deploy the example application using EAP 8.1 Helm charts

```
helm install eap81-source-build-app -f helm.yaml jboss-eap/eap81
```

3. Access the endpoint

```
curl https://$(oc get route eap81-source-build-app --template='{{ .spec.host }}')/
```
